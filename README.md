# Concurrent Process Management with Threading
This Java project demonstrates concurrent process management through a server-client architecture, utilizing threading for efficient communication. The system encompasses a server-side component, ProcessServer, and client-side components, ConsumerClient and ProducerClient. These clients interact with a shared buffer, implemented in the Buffer class, allowing the concurrent production and consumption of items.

## Threading Implementation
The project employs Java threads to achieve parallelism and efficient process handling. The Main class orchestrates two threads, t1 and t2, to showcase the concurrent execution of item production and consumption within the shared buffer.
